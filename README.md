# Wordpress-Useful-Snippets
Code snippets that get repeated from project to project.

To start a theme:

1. Create a folder on local server (using OpenServer or any other). I prefer to name that foler something like "projectname.loc"
2. Download Wordpress from Wordpress.org and unzip it to the project folder
3. Generate the theme template at underscores.me and unzip it in the themes folder
3. Open phpMyAdmin (L: Root P: -) and create a database (utf8_general_ci)
4. Start the server as administartor and open the website 
5. On DB setup page change the table prefix
6. On the installation page discourage search engines from indexing
